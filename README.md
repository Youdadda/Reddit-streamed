Following a period of intensive learning and skill development, this data pipeline project has undergone a significant architectural revamp. The core objective of this restructuring was to transition the codebase from a development-centric artifact to a robust, production-ready system characterized by clean code, established standards, and operational efficiency.

Key Improvements and Outcomes:

1. Architectural Restructuring: The entire project directory and file structure have been reorganized to follow industry best practices, improving modularity and reducing interdependencies.

2. The Gold Table has been meticulously refined to ensure feature vectors are clean, tokenized, and precisely prepared for subsequent Machine Learning (ML) tasks, maximizing model performance.

3. Added a Makefile to make
